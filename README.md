# A basic introduction

This Repo is a demonstration of the PCA algorithm to clean data, find the eigenvectors of a dataset which can be used to optimize the learning rate of a neural network. This is a project meant to 

SciKit Learn does have a default method implemented for PCA.

The notable use of this project is to perform the PCA and save the PCA data to a file for later use.

The covariance matrix is defined from a
